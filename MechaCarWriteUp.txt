Residual standard error: 8.774 on 44 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared:  0.7149,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.6825 
F-statistic: 22.07 on 5 and 44 DF,  p-value: 5.35e-11

Analysis:
Looking at the results of the multiple regression analysis conducted the following is concluded:
1) According to our results, vehicle length, ground clearance and intercept are variables that are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to this linear model. This is beacuse their Pr(>|t|), the probability that each coefficient contributes a random variance is really low.

2) Since the p-value for this multiple regression model is significantly lower than the signifcance level, 0.05, therefore there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis which states that the slope of the regression model is 0.  This means that there is a linear correlation between the mpg and the other variables.

3) Since the R squared value is 0.7149, this indicates that this model can effectively predict mpg of MechaCars in the future. The r-squared value of 0.715 indicates that 71% of the time the future data will fit to this linear regression model which is considered a high likelehood probability, and therefore it is a strong regression model.

2) Suspension Coil Summary:

Mean_PSI	Median_PSI	Variance_PSI	Stdev_PSI
1498.78	      1500	    62.29356	    7.892627

Looking at the data, the mean of the PSI data is 1499 pounds per inch, while the median of the data is 1500 pounds per inch. Since the mean is almost the same as the median it can be concluded that the data isn't skewed. The variance of the PSI is 62.29 pounds per inch which means that the data varies away from the mean by 62.29. One of the design specification of MechaCar states that the variance of the suspension coil must not exceed 100 pounds per inch which means that according to the given data it meets the company's design requirements.

3) Suspension Coil t-Test:

	One Sample t-test

data:  (Susp_coil_sample_table$PSI)
t = -0.30128, df = 49, p-value = 0.7645
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 1498.78
95 percent confidence interval:
 1496.019 1500.821
sample estimates:
mean of x 
  1498.42 
  
Since the p-value is 0.76 which is significantly higher than the 0.05 signifcance level, there isn't enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis and therefore the means of the sample and the PSI coil population is similar. Also the mean of the sample PSI data is 1498.42 which is almost similar to the mean of the PSI population found in the summary table above which is 1498.78.
